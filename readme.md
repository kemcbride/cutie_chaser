Note: this is specifically for stepmania/openITG.

Sometimes I want to listen to music of packs for fun, and looking up the
tracks one by one can be annoying.

idea: create youtube playlists based on packs - that way when you want to check out a pack
but for some reason don't have access to stepmania/itg on hand (idk, browsing r21freak on mobile)
you can just search up a playlist (in an ideal world) and peep it.

Often when you hear stuff in a pack, it's random crap you don't know.

## Technically Speaking

All it does is hop onto the youtube API and do a search using the artist and title
specified in the .sm file and grab the first result. So yeah, it can TOTALLY be wrong.

But usually it's not.

Peep these, for example:

[Animusic Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDltB4AvoY&list=PL_B30pn44WOVuiAsWCWGgf2mA-153un7G)
- two errors as far as I can tell, out of 41 tracks?

[Ninjafar's Insanely Cute Electronic Simfile Troop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys9sIqv42lo&list=PL_B30pn44WOU-QqkJIwVhPp6xu0Y09DMj)
- no errors as far as I can tell, out of 12 tracks?
